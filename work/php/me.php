<p><img src="img/me.jpg" width="500" alt="Me on an image"></p>

<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. Keep this site updated all through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

<p>My name is Stina Ahlström, born and raised in Helsingborg, Skåne. Before starting Computer Science I worked as a salesperson at Telenor.</p>

<p>I have never done programming before starting Computer Science but I keep learning everyday and I really enjoy it! </p>

<p>My hobbies are horses and showjumping. </p>

<p>Lets keep in touch in the chatt and through GitHub!</p>
