<h1>My report page in the course XXX</h1>

<p><img src="img/me.jpg" width="500" alt="Me on an image"></p>

<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. Keep this site updated all through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

<p>So, a presentation might be in order. I'll begin.</p>

<p>My name is Stina Ahlström, born and raised in Helsingborg, Skåne. Before starting Computer Science I worked as an in store salesperson at Telenor </p>

<p>Programming has always been an interest of mine, ever since I was 13 years old and got my first computer, a Spectravideo 328 with tape recorde.</p>

<p>If I should mention a hobby</p>

<p>Hobbies.</p>

<p>Lets keep in touch in the chatt and through GitHub!</p>
