<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. Keep this site updated all through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

<p>My name is Stina Ahlström, born and raised in Helsingborg, Skåne. Before starting Computer Science I worked as an in store salesperson at Telenor </p>

<p>I have never done programming before starting Computer Science but I keep learning everyday and I really enjoy it! </p>

<p>My hobbies are horses and showjumping. I've always love to beeing in the barn. </p>

<p>Hobbies.</p>
