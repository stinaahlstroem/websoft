    <h2>S01</h2>
    <p>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
    <p>I did know about Github since we have used it a little bit in the other courses.</p>
    <p>It’s good to learn how to push/commit etc from the command since we have used Github</p>
    <p>desktop most of the time. It has been easier since we haven’t got that much knowledge</p>
    <p>about how to use real Git.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Have you ever created websites before?</p>
    <p>We did some in the Software Engineering 2 but only the basic parts so it will be a</p>
    <p>great learning experience to learn more about how to create one.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
    <p>We have had some courses before but I feel like it was quite little so I would say</p> 
    <p>that I'm a total beginner and I’m looking forward to learn more about it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>To learn more about how to use Github from the command prompt. how to Visual Studio Code</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
    <h2>S02</h2>
    <p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
    <p>No, we have not had any courses that was teaching us how to code in this languages.</p>
    <p>We have done some CSS within projects but only very little.</p>
    <br> 
    <p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>
    <p>HTML is a programming language which is the skeleton of the information on a web page.</p>
    <p>CSS is controlling the web pages appearance and JavaScript stands for the programming</p>
    <p>functionalities.</p>
    <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript is the essentials for building a website.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>
    <p>A browser communicates with a web server through HTTP protocol.</p>
    <p>A browser makes a request to a web server to return a specific resource such as an image,</p>
    <p>video or webpage. Depending on the authenticity of the request, a server then returns the</p>
    <p>requested resource.</p>
    <br>   
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>To learn more about CSS HTML and JavaScript and how to make them integrate with each other.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
    <h2>S03</h2>
    <p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
    <p>No, I have never worked with client side javascript before or with JavaScpipt but I think</p>
    <p>it's a fun language to work with.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
    <p>I have only worked with Java but I think JavaScpipt is similar in some ways. I find it</p>
    <p>fun to work with.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did</p>
    <p>your code turn out to be?</p>
    <p>I did it with the help of youtube videos and google to find css etc. I aim for grade 3.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>To get more into javascript code and css. I think it is fun to add styling and its good</p>
    <p>that it's possible to try it before adding to the code by F12 in the windows.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
    <h2>S04</h2>
    <p>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
    <p>I have tried node a little bit. Programming tools that I have used before is git, github,</p>
    <p>MySql, bootstrap, Visual studios.</p>
    <br>
    <p>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
    <p>I think it is fun once you get more knowledge about how to use it and integrate with the</p>
    <p>different programs.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
    <p>It worked after some research and tutorials. I found some information on StackOverflow and</p>
    <p>tried in the devtools before adding it to the project.</p>
    <br>
    <p> What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
    <p>I aimed for grade 3 since it was quite a lot new information.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>Today I learned how to work with express and Node and how to use them as a server instead of XAMPP.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
    <h2>S05</h2>
    <p>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>
    <p>I think it's quite straight forward </p>
    <br>
    <p>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>
    <p>I have only worked with Java and JavaScpipt so it was a bit different with example $ dollar</p>
    <p>sign before variables.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied</p>
    <p>with the result?</p>
    <p>I aimed for grade 3 and I did all the topics for grade 3. I think it was quite straight forward</p>
    <p>but I had some difficulties with the MySql</p>
    <p>connection to the database but once I got that solved the rest worked out quite well.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>I learned how to do some PHP coding and how to integrate php, JavaScpipt and Mysql into one</p>
    <p>project.</p>

    <h2>S06</h2>
    <p>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts</p>
    <p>of future popularity among programming languages?</p>
    <p>Since I have not been programming before my education I have only got the feeling that Java </p>
    <p>and C# seems to be a common programming language around workplaces. I think Java gives the</p>
    <p>programmer more help and suggestions than what C# does. It’s important to find information</p>
    <p>in how to solve an error if needed and I feel like Java is easier to find such information </p>
    <p>and the program itself gives good ideas in how to solve the issue.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</p>
    <p>I would choose Java at first but that is only because it’s the language that I feel most comfortable</p>
    <p>and since we have been using it a lot in school. Many websites and social platforms seems to be </p>
    <p>developed in JavaScript and the more I get to code in it the more I like it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com to customize your own comparison on programming</p>
    <p>languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results. </p>
    <p>Due to the result in what people in Sweden are searching mostly for Java or JavaScript it is quite</p>
    <p>close but JavaScript has always the leading position between those two. Based on the statistics northern</p>
    <p>part of sweden and southern search more on JavaScript than the middle part.</p>

    <br>
    <p>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next</p>
    <p>large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</p>
    <p>I would choose JavaScript since it seems easy to use and to integrate with other programming languages.</p>
    <p>I would sell it by informing in how many big platforms that is using it today and that it is quite</p>
    <p>easy to find information if one doesn’t know how to program in it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>To get more into what programming languages is the most popular ones around the globe and what type</p>
    <p>of language developers are using it certain matters.</p>

    <h2>S07</h2>
    <p>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this</p>
    <p>Microsoft technology. ASP.NET is a web application framework. It is developed by Microsoft</p>
    <p>and it makes developers allowed to build dynamic websites with full features to integrate</p>
    <p>with language like C# or VB.NET.</p>
    <br> 
    <p>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the</p>
    <p>course.</p>
    <p>comparing asp.net, node.js, php: ASP.NET is an open-source server-side web application </p>
    <p>framework which allows the programmer to build dynamic web applications and web services.</p>
    <p>Asp.net is highly security priority. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for </p>
    <p>web development. PHP is more efficient when building  e-commerce websites and for managing</p>
    <p>dynamic content. Php is less built-in features for security.ASP.NET is better suited for large </p>
    <p>and medium-sized organization whereas PHP is better equipped to server start-up and small </p>
    <p>sized organizations. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform which let the developers use</p>
    <p>JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting to produce dynamic webpage</p>
    <p>content before the page is sent to the user’s web browser. Node.js is as secure as almost any </p>
    <p>programming languages but it is more up to the development team to check their code and modules</p>
    <p>for vulnerabilities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied</p>
    <p>with the result?</p>
    <p>I aimed for grade 3 and I’m satisfied with the result since I have never been programming in</p>
    <p>.Net or C#</p>
    <br>  
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>I learned how to use .NET platform and to use C#. I have never been coding in C# before but</p>
    <p>I think it went quite well.</p>
