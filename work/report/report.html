<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
<p>I did know about Github since we have used it a little bit in the other courses.</p>
<p>It’s good to learn how to push/commit etc from the command since we have used Github</p>
<p>desktop most of the time. It has been easier since we haven’t got that much knowledge</p>
<p>about how to use real Git.</p>
<br>
<p>Have you ever created websites before?</p>
<p>We did some in the Software Engineering 2 but only the basic parts so it will be a</p>
<p>great learning experience to learn more about how to create one.</p>
<br>
<p>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
<p>We have had some courses before but I feel like it was quite little so I would say</p> 
<p>that I'm a total beginner and I’m looking forward to learn more about it.</p>
